Data Preprocessing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extraction from dicom:
    Write a script for taking the pixel data from each dicom in a scan and
    stacking into a 3d array, as well as recording neccesary metadata like 
    pixel spacing, slice spacing, slice thickness, etc
    Data should stay saved in a raw format of stacked slices of pixel data 
    + metadata so that different preprocessing techniques can be used on the 
    raw data.

Data Preparation:

    Isomorphic Resampling:
    Determine what resolution the data should be resampled to (ie. 1mm x 1mm x 1mm)
    Probably will need to experiment with different resolutions
    Follow https://www.kaggle.com/code/gzuidhof/full-preprocessing-tutorial, and make
    sure that credit / citation is given to author of the code
    Also determine what the real-world dimensions of the data should be set to, ie
    smaller sized data will be given zero padding to be used with larger data.
    This will also help in deciding on resampling resolution.

    Data Normalization:
    Research data normalization techniques and best practices including mean subtraction,
    zero-centering, and anything else that might help.

    Data Augmentation:
    Research and determine best data augmentation techniques to use, and consider
    that the dataset is very small. Noise will probably be the most important
